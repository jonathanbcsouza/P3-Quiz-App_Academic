# UdacityInterview
It`s my simple Quiz app that I made to Android Developer Course from Udacity.
I used string to make translations from English to portuguese.
This app, take score questions, make calculates the score and share a report to e-mail. I used the Intent object for this.
If you have soe questions, please ask me.
Thanks,
Jonathan.
